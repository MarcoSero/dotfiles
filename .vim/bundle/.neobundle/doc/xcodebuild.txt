INTRODUCTION                           *xcodebuild*

Xcodebuild.vim is a thin wrapper around Apple's xcodebuild command line
application that lets you build and test your Xcode projects from within vim.
It dynamically figures out your project information and passes the proper
flags to xcodebuild.

If you have xcpretty installed, it will use that to reformat the output from
xcodebuild. By default, xcodebuild.vim passes the `--color` flag to xcpretty.

CONFIGURATION                             *xcodebuild-configuration*

* Set the runner to use for the xcodebuild command (uses ! by default)
 let g:xcodebuild_run_command = 'VtrSendCommandToRunner! {cmd}'

* Set the flags passed to xcpretty for all actions, including test actions.
 let g:xcodebuild_xcpretty_flags = '--color'

* Set the flags passed to xcpretty for test actions only. These flags will not
  be sent when building.
 let g:xcodebuild_xcpretty_testing_flags = '--simple'

# dotfiles

These are my dotfiles.

## Setup and notes

I use [Mackup](https://github.com/lra/mackup) (and Dropbox) to manage and sync
them across different laptops, so there are no custom scripts to install them.

I only use OSX, so multi platform support is not a priority for me. Bear
that in mind if you try them on Linux or Windows.

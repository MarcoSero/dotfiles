;;; Commentary:

;; Speck is a minor mode for "specking" - spell-checking text displayed
;; in Emacs windows.  Invoke the command `speck-mode' to toggle specking
;; of all windows showing the current buffer.

;; Change Log:
;; 2014/08/30 York Zhao
;;     Add support to allow binding a lisp function to a "replace key" in
;;     `speck-replace-keys' and/or `speck-replace-map', so that one can define a
;;     function to do more hacking. For instance, one can define a function, and
;;     bind it to the ESC key in `speck-replace-keys' and/or
;;     `speck-replace-map', to decide whether to accept the speck correction, by
;;     returning non-nil, or reject it, by returning nil. One use case is that
;;     in Evil, a Vim emulation in Emacs, one can allow ESC to accept a speck
;;     correction only in insert state.
;; 2014/04/16 York Zhao
;;     Fix whitespace, replace TABs with spaces.
;; 2013/12/30 York Zhao
;;     Require the `cl-lib', instead of `cl'
;; 2013/05/19 Andrei Chițu
;;     bugfix: bugfix: in `speck-windows' check that `window' is non-nil before specking it
;;     bugfix: keep case of dictionary names in `speck-hunspell-dictionary-alist'
;; 2013/02/03 Frank Fischer
;;     Add LIMIT to `looking-back' in `speck-auto-correct-after-change'.
;;     Set `speck-auto-correct-after-change' to nil.

The following choices are available:

None ......... Do not read or write multi-dictionary information.

End of file .. Write multi-dictionary information at end of file.

Standard ..... Intersperse multi-dictionary information with text.

When you choose \"None\" no multi-dictionary annotations are read
even if the file contains them.  The other two options read
annotations as they are found on the file but differ in the way
they write them out.  The \"Standard\" method puts strings
\(\"<<speck-foo:\" and \"speck-foo>>\") around every single
stretch of text checked in the language \"foo\".  If these
strings confuse other applications operating on that file, use
the \"End of file\" method which puts all annotations on a
single, commented-out line at the end of the file.

Note 1: Neither \"Standard\" nor \"End of file\" will handle
insertion of parts of files into a buffer correctly.  If you want
to insert a subsection of a file containing multi-dictionary
information it's strongly recommended to visit that file in
another buffer first and subsequently yank the desired part(s) to
the final target.

Note 2: The \"End of file\" method may fail to install
multi-dictionary information properly if you decode a file
differently than you encoded it.  Hence, if you want to preserve
multi-dictionary information when switching to another coding
system you should \(temporarily) use the \"Standard\" method.

Note 3: Setting this option to \"Standard\" or \"End of file\"
adds a suitable entry to `format-alist'.  Implicitly, this will
add a \(commented-out) line at file-beginning when writing the
buffer to the visited file.  Resetting this option to \"None\"
removes the entry from `format-alist' but doesn't remove the line
and the corresponding annotations from the file until you
explicitly save the buffer."
